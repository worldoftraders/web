        <h4>Alpha test users</h4>
        <p>First of all, thanks for your time. It’s really important to me.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind World of Traders is in a very early stage. It has a very basic set of features, I have plans to extend it (a lot) from here.</p>
        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p>Email: <a href="mailto:albert@worldoftradersgame.com">albert@worldoftradersgame.com</a><br>
        Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/worldoftraders">https://twitter.com/worldoftraders</a></p>
        <p>Please, send me feedback after you play. Anything. I really mean it, it’s really helpful to know what other people thinks about your work in order to improve it.</p>
        <p>Doesn’t need to be just things you’d change, but ideas or any random thought you had (related with the game if posible) will be useful.</p>
        <h4>What can I do?</h4>
        <p>There’s no save/load game yet. So run the game every time you want to start a new game.</p>
        <p>You’ll see a terrain with some areas highlighted. They can be either cities or belong to other companies. Right now there’s only one city in the center, you can click on the buildings to see what they are.</p>
        <p>You can start buy buying some land for your business.<br>
        Then I suggest to build an HQ and a warehouse to begin with. The HQ will dislpay the resources you own across all the pieces of land you own. The warehouse will automatically store all the resources generated in the land it’s located.</p>
        <p>Time to start your business. Decide what you want to focus on and buy buildings of that kind.<br>
        If you’re not sure how to start, try building a Forest, Sawmill and Paper factory. This will start a production chain that will end up with some Paper that you can sell to the shop.<br>
        To sell to the shop, click on your warehouse, click on ‘Sell’ and select the paper shop as a destination. This will show you a window with the details of the transaction.</p>
        <p>You can also trade with other companies. You must be having some extra Timber in your warehouse. You can either go around and find other companies interested in your timber, or build another paper factory to increase your production.<br>
        You can also add an interest on your warehouse to tell you’re interested in selling Timber and wait for other companies to send you trading contracts. You’ll find them in the ‘Trading contracts’ list.</p>
        <p>If you get lost you can always open the ‘My buildings’ list and click on any of your buildings to see it.</p>
        <p>Production buildings can be upgraded to work faster, more efficient or cheaper.</p>
        <p>After you’re done playing the game, please re-visit the Feedback section of this document to know what to do next.</p>
